Trees
===========================

### 1. Binary Search Tree

Module `binary_tree.py` contains an implementation of the Binary Search Tree
including `insert`, `delete` and inorder/postorder tree walks.

### 2. AVL Tree

Module `avl_tree.py` contains AVL tree implementation extended from the BST implementation. 

### 3. Red Black Tree

Module `red_black_tree.py` contains an implementation of the Red Black Tree
based on materials from Chapter 13 of Cormen & Leierson.


For the comparison of `search` and `delete` operations performance in BST vs AVL  
see the table in `simple_bst_comparison.csv`.

to run tests execute `python -m unittest discover -v`
