RAM-model class solutions
===========================

These 3 tasks are using EMU Studio's [abstract RAM-machine implementation](http://www.emustudio.net/docuser/ram/index/)
 to run. See the [docs](http://www.emustudio.net/download/) on how to download and use it.
 
`division.ram` contains simple integer division with remainder implementation

`multiplication.ram` contains multiplication through addition implementation

`sorting.ram` contains bubble sort implementation
