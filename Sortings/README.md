5. Sortings
===========================

### 1. Insertion sort and Shell sort

Package `insertion` contains a simple implementation of the Insertion sort

Package `shell` contains an implementation of the Shell sort

File `shell_and_insertion_comparison.py` contains various benchmarks of
Shell and Insertion sort of arrays of different lengths, various degrees
of pre-ordering and different gap-sequences for Shell sort.
(see [Gap sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort))

For the results see `sort_comparison.csv`
